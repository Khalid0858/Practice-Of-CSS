        <h1>Bangladesh 2.O</h1>
        <p>In a defining moment of our history, Bangladesh is undergoing a monumental transformation. <br>
            After more than 15 years under a regime marked by corruption, oppression and exploitation, a courageous revolution led by our students has ignited a new era.<br> The fall of this autocratic government has paved the way for an unprecedented opportunity to rebuild our beloved nation under the interim leadership of Dr. Muhammad Yunus—Nobel laureate, visionary economist, and a beacon of hope. <br>
            This new chapter, "Bangladesh 2.0," represents not just a political shift, but the rekindling of our national spirit.</p>

        <h2>Why The Revolation Starts</h2>
        <p>The previous administration left our country in tatters.<br> Under that regime, corruption seeped into every corner of government and society, undermining institutions crucial for the nation’s functioning.<br> The law enforcement agencies, central bank, and public administration were systematically crippled, creating a chasm between the state and its people.<br> The economy was in shambles, education systems were failing, crime rates soared, and freedom of speech was crushed under the heavy boot of authoritarianism.<br> The collective anguish of our people was palpable, as voices of dissent were met with brutal repression.</p>
